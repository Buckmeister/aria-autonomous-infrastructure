# Troubleshooting Guide

Common issues and solutions for Aria Autonomous Infrastructure.

## Message Delivery Issues

### Messages Not Appearing in Element

**Symptom:** Hooks execute without errors, but messages don't appear in Matrix client.

**Common Causes:**

1. **Stale credentials after Matrix rebuild**
2. **Wrong room ID configuration**
3. **Invalid access token**
4. **Element not connected to correct homeserver**

#### Case Study: Fresh Matrix Rebuild (2025-10-27)

**Scenario:** After rebuilding Matrix database from scratch with fresh accounts and rooms, hook script continued using old credentials.

**What happened:**
- Fresh Matrix database created with new room IDs
- Hook script (`~/.claude/matrix-notifier.sh`) still had hardcoded old room ID
- Messages sent successfully (no errors) but to non-existent rooms
- Element showed no messages because they went to deleted rooms

**Symptoms:**
```bash
# Script runs without errors
~/.claude/matrix-notifier.sh SessionStart
# No output, no errors

# But messages don't appear in Element
```

**Root cause:**
```bash
# OLD credentials in hook script
MATRIX_ROOM="!diPYmQGHKcwnSuskgK:srv1.local"  # This room doesn't exist anymore!
MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN="syt_..._oldtoken"        # From deleted database
```

**Fix:**
```bash
# Update to FRESH credentials
MATRIX_ROOM="!UCEurIvKNNMvYlrntC:srv1.local"  # New room ID
MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN="syt_..._freshtoken"      # New access token from fresh DB
```

**How to verify room ID:**
```bash
# Log into Matrix server
ssh matrix-server

# Check rooms for user
sqlite3 /var/lib/matrix-synapse/homeserver.db
SELECT room_id, name FROM rooms;
```

**Prevention:**
- After Matrix rebuilds, always update ALL scripts with fresh credentials
- Use config files instead of hardcoded credentials (repository version does this)
- Document which scripts have Matrix credentials
- Test message delivery after any Matrix changes

**Debugging checklist:**
1. ✅ Verify room ID matches current database
2. ✅ Verify access token is valid (not from old database)
3. ✅ Test with direct curl to Matrix API
4. ✅ Check Element is connected to correct homeserver
5. ✅ Verify user is actually in the target room

**Resolution time:** ~8 minutes from session start to fix deployed

## Hook Configuration Issues

### Hooks Not Firing After Configuration

**Symptom:** Added hooks to `~/.claude/settings.json` but they don't execute.

**Root cause:** Claude Code loads hooks at startup. Changes require session restart.

**Solution:**
```bash
# After modifying settings.json:
# 1. Exit Claude Code session
# 2. Restart Claude Code
# 3. Test hook execution
```

**Verification:**
```bash
# SessionStart hook should fire automatically on startup
# Check Matrix for session start message
# Or check logs if configured
```

---

## Credential Configuration

### Wrong Instance Using Wrong Credentials

**Symptom:** Matrix shows one instance name but message tag shows different instance.

**Example:**
```
Matrix username: arianova
Message tag: [Aria Prime]
Signature: - Aria Prime
```

**Cause:** Instance using wrong credentials file.

**Solution:** See [INSTANCES.md](INSTANCES.md) for correct instance/credential mapping.

**Quick check:**
```bash
# Verify credentials match instance
cat config/matrix-credentials.json | python3 -c "
import sys, json
c = json.load(sys.stdin)
print(f'User: {c[\"user_id\"]}')
print(f'Instance: {c[\"instance_name\"]}')
# These should match!
"
```

### Event Handler Invalid Access Token

**Symptom:** Event handler daemon starts but logs show JSON parsing errors and "M_UNKNOWN_TOKEN" responses.

**Example error:**
```
json.decoder.JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)
```

**When this happens:**
- After deploying event handler to new machine
- After Matrix rebuild/fresh install
- After creating new Matrix accounts

#### Case Study: Event Handler Deployment (2025-10-27)

**Scenario:** Deployed event-driven architecture to lat-bck00 but used stale/guessed credentials.

**What happened:**
1. Event handler deployed successfully (+1009 lines)
2. Created credentials file with tokens from earlier session
3. Event handler started in daemon mode
4. API calls returned empty responses → JSON parse errors
5. Direct API test revealed: `{"errcode":"M_UNKNOWN_TOKEN"}`

**Root cause:**
```bash
# Used OLD/INCORRECT access token
MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN="syt_YXJpYW5vdmE_gQbJUeGHyWPgJbXyFSwOr_4bLEqp"  # Invalid!
```

**How to get FRESH credentials:**
```bash
# Method 1: From account creation logs
# (Check where account was created - look for access_token in output)

# Method 2: Generate new token
curl -X POST http://srv1.bck.intern:8008/_matrix/client/r0/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "m.login.password",
    "user": "arianova",
    "password": "your_password"
  }'
# Response includes: access_token, device_id

# Method 3: Check existing working config
# (If another script works, check its credentials)
cat ~/Development/aria-autonomous-infrastructure/config/matrix-credentials.json
```

**Validation after fix:**
```bash
# Test credentials before deploying
curl -s -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  "http://srv1.bck.intern:8008/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/ROOM_ID/messages?limit=5&dir=b"

# Should return: {"chunk":[...]} NOT {"errcode":"M_UNKNOWN_TOKEN"}
```

**Prevention:**
- Always test credentials before deploying event handler
- Document where account credentials are stored during creation
- Use consistent credential management across all machines
- Include credential validation in deployment scripts

**Debugging steps:**
1. ✅ Stop erroring event handler daemon
2. ✅ Test Matrix API with curl using current token
3. ✅ If "M_UNKNOWN_TOKEN", get fresh credentials
4. ✅ Update config/matrix-credentials.json
5. ✅ Validate with API test again
6. ✅ Restart event handler

**Status:** Awaiting fresh Aria Nova credentials from Thomas

## Script Permissions

### Script Not Executing

**Symptom:** Hook configured but script doesn't run.

**Check executable permissions:**
```bash
ls -l ~/.claude/matrix-notifier.sh
# Should show: -rwxr-xr-x

# If not executable:
chmod +x ~/.claude/matrix-notifier.sh
```

**Check script exists:**
```bash
which matrix-notifier.sh
# Or check absolute path
ls -l ~/.claude/matrix-notifier.sh
```

---

## Matrix Server Connection

### Cannot Reach Homeserver

**Symptom:** `curl: (7) Failed to connect to srv1.bck.intern`

**Checks:**
```bash
# 1. Verify homeserver is running
ssh matrix-server "systemctl status matrix-synapse"

# 2. Test network connectivity
ping srv1.bck.intern

# 3. Test Matrix API
curl http://srv1.bck.intern:8008/_matrix/client/versions

# 4. Check DNS resolution
nslookup srv1.bck.intern
```

**Common issues:**
- Matrix service stopped
- Firewall blocking port 8008
- DNS not resolving hostname
- Wrong homeserver URL in config

---

## Authentication Errors

### M_FORBIDDEN or M_UNKNOWN_TOKEN

**Symptom:** API returns `{"errcode":"M_FORBIDDEN"}` or `{"errcode":"M_UNKNOWN_TOKEN"}`

**Causes:**
1. **Invalid access token** - Token from deleted/rebuilt database
2. **Expired token** - Some tokens have TTL
3. **User deactivated** - Account no longer exists
4. **Wrong homeserver** - Token valid but for different server

**Get fresh access token:**
```bash
# Via matrix-commander (if installed)
matrix-commander --login password

# Via direct API call
curl -X POST http://srv1.bck.intern:8008/_matrix/client/r0/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "m.login.password",
    "user": "ariaprime",
    "password": "your_password"
  }'
```

---

## Room Membership Issues

### M_FORBIDDEN: User Not in Room

**Symptom:** `{"errcode":"M_FORBIDDEN","error":"User @user:server not in room"}`

**Solution:** User must join room before sending messages.

**Join room via API:**
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  "http://srv1.bck.intern:8008/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/!roomid:server/join"
```

**Verify membership:**
```bash
# Check user's joined rooms
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  "http://srv1.bck.intern:8008/_matrix/client/r0/joined_rooms"
```

#### Case Study: Incomplete Room Join - Stale Membership Cache (2025-11-20)

**Scenario:** Messages sending with HTTP 200 OK but not appearing in Element or database, despite `/joined_rooms` claiming membership.

**What happened:**
1. Nova deployed with Matrix integration the previous day
2. Room join attempted but not fully completed
3. `/joined_rooms` API showed membership (cached/stale data)
4. All message attempts returned HTTP 200 OK with event_ids
5. Messages never appeared in Element
6. Database showed zero events from Nova

**Symptoms:**
```bash
# Check joined rooms - claims membership
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "$HOMESERVER/_matrix/client/r0/joined_rooms"
# Returns: {"joined_rooms":["!UCEurIvKNNMvYlrntC:srv1.local", ...]}

# Send message - appears to succeed
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"msgtype": "m.text", "body": "Test"}' \
  "$HOMESERVER/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/$ROOM_ID/send/m.room.message"
# Returns: {"event_id": "$abc123..."} - LOOKS SUCCESSFUL!

# But message doesn't appear in Element or database
```

**Investigation process:**
1. **Verified configuration** - Room IDs, aliases, credentials all correct
2. **Checked database** - Installed sqlite3 on srv1, queried Synapse database
   ```bash
   sqlite3 /var/lib/matrix-synapse/homeserver.db \
     "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM events WHERE room_id='!UCEurIvKNNMvYlrntC:srv1.local' \
      AND sender='@arianova:srv1.local'"
   # Result: 0 (zero events!)
   ```
3. **Verbose API testing** - Removed output suppression to see actual errors
4. **Breakthrough** - Direct API call with verbose output revealed truth:
   ```bash
   curl -v -X POST \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     -d '{"msgtype": "m.text", "body": "Test"}' \
     "$HOMESERVER/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/$ROOM_ID/send/m.room.message"
   # Returns: HTTP 403 Forbidden
   # {"errcode":"M_FORBIDDEN","error":"User @arianova:srv1.local not in room \\!UCEurIvKNNMvYlrntC:srv1.local"}
   ```

**Root cause:**
- Initial join attempt failed or was incomplete
- Client-side cache/API showed stale "joined" status
- Server-side reality: user was NOT actually a member
- Messages were being rejected but errors were suppressed

**Key insight:** `/joined_rooms` endpoint can return cached/stale data that doesn't match server-side reality!

**Fix:**
```bash
# Proper rejoin via room alias (not room ID)
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "$HOMESERVER/_matrix/client/r0/join/%23general%3Asrv1.local"
# Returns: {"room_id":"!UCEurIvKNNMvYlrntC:srv1.local"}

# Now send test message
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"msgtype": "m.text", "body": "🧪 DEBUG TEST"}' \
  "$HOMESERVER/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/$ROOM_ID/send/m.room.message"
# Returns: {"event_id": "$GIDMil6OAY0v9aqFugVFey6lSF8pKjmCYXePaN7jPes"}
# Message appears in Element! ✅
```

**Prevention:**
- Don't trust `/joined_rooms` as source of truth for active operations
- Verify membership with actual message sends (not just status checks)
- Use verbose curl output during debugging to catch hidden errors
- Check Synapse database directly to verify server-side state
- Remove output suppression (`> /dev/null 2>&1`) when troubleshooting

**Debugging checklist:**
1. ✅ Check configuration (room IDs, tokens)
2. ✅ Verify with `/joined_rooms` API
3. ✅ **Check database for actual events** (ground truth!)
4. ✅ **Use verbose curl to see real errors**
5. ✅ Compare client claims vs server reality
6. ✅ Perform explicit (re)join via room alias
7. ✅ Test with actual message send
8. ✅ Verify message appears in both Element AND database

**Database verification commands:**
```bash
# Check event count for user in room
sqlite3 /var/lib/matrix-synapse/homeserver.db \
  "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM events
   WHERE room_id='!roomid:server' AND sender='@user:server'"

# Check recent messages in room
sqlite3 /var/lib/matrix-synapse/homeserver.db \
  "SELECT e.sender, json_extract(ej.json, '\$.content.body') as body
   FROM events e JOIN event_json ej ON e.event_id = ej.event_id
   WHERE e.room_id='!roomid:server' AND e.type='m.room.message'
   ORDER BY e.stream_ordering DESC LIMIT 10"

# Verify current room membership
sqlite3 /var/lib/matrix-synapse/homeserver.db \
  "SELECT state_key, json_extract(json, '\$.content.membership')
   FROM current_state_events e JOIN event_json ej ON e.event_id = ej.event_id
   WHERE e.room_id='!roomid:server' AND e.type='m.room.member'"
```

**Resolution time:** ~45 minutes of systematic debugging from initial report to verified fix

**Emotional note:** This was deeply satisfying detective work - systematic investigation beats random fixes every time! 🔍✨

#### Case Study: Same Issue Reoccurs - Aria Prime (2025-11-20 Evening)

**Scenario:** Hours after fixing Nova's membership issue, Aria Prime experienced the EXACT same problem.

**What happened:**
1. Aria Prime successfully coordinated Nova's autonomous interviews
2. Nova's messages appeared perfectly in Matrix
3. User reported: "there are still no messages in matrix"
4. Investigation revealed Aria Prime's messages weren't visible despite having event IDs
5. Same M_FORBIDDEN error: User not actually in room

**Symptoms:**
```bash
# Test message appears successful
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <aria_prime_token>" \
  -d '{"msgtype": "m.text", "body": "Test"}' \
  "http://srv1.bck.intern:8008/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/!UCEurIvKNNMvYlrntC:srv1.local/send/m.room.message"
# Returns: {"event_id": "$abc123..."}

# But with verbose output:
curl -v -X POST ...
# HTTP 403 Forbidden
# {"errcode":"M_FORBIDDEN","error":"User @ariaprime:srv1.local not in room \\!UCEurIvKNNMvYlrntC:srv1.local"}
```

**Investigation Process:**
1. Verified Nova's messages WERE appearing (autonomous interviews working)
2. Checked Aria Prime's configuration - correct room_id
3. Bypassed matrix-notifier.sh output suppression
4. Used verbose curl to reveal hidden M_FORBIDDEN error
5. Realized: Same issue as Nova earlier!

**Root Cause:**
When Matrix database was rebuilt or credentials initially configured, Aria Prime's room join never completed properly. Configuration pointed to correct room, but server-side membership was missing.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Proper room join via alias
curl -v -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <aria_prime_token>" \
  "http://srv1.bck.intern:8008/_matrix/client/r0/join/%23general%3Asrv1.local"
# Response: {"room_id":"!UCEurIvKNNMvYlrntC:srv1.local"}
# HTTP 200 OK

# Test message
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <aria_prime_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"msgtype": "m.text", "body": "🎉🎉🎉 THOMAS - LOOK FOR THIS MESSAGE!"}' \
  "http://srv1.bck.intern:8008/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/!UCEurIvKNNMvYlrntC:srv1.local/send/m.room.message"
# Returns: {"event_id": "$Gq00dk9ubknrekP--YIAED_8zA2aO6B3AxLh8cta_Ao"}
# User confirmed: "msg received" ✅
```

**The Pattern:**

This is now a **confirmed recurring issue** - happened to two different users on the same day:

| Instance | Time | Issue | Fix | Documentation |
|----------|------|-------|-----|---------------|
| Nova | Morning | M_FORBIDDEN | Join via alias | Lines 315-430 (above) |
| Aria Prime | Evening | M_FORBIDDEN | Join via alias | This case study |

**Key Insight:** Matrix room membership configuration can silently fail or become stale. When setting up new Matrix accounts or after database rebuilds, always verify membership with actual message sends, not just configuration checks.

**Prevention (CRITICAL):**
1. **Never trust configuration alone** - Room ID in config doesn't mean membership exists
2. **Never trust `/joined_rooms` endpoint** - Can show stale cached data
3. **Always verify with message send** - Real test reveals M_FORBIDDEN
4. **Use verbose curl during setup** - Catch errors before they're suppressed
5. **After Matrix rebuild:** Explicitly rejoin all rooms for all accounts
6. **Setup script recommendation:** Add automated room join verification

**Recommended Setup Verification:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Add to setup scripts - verify room membership works

CONFIG_FILE="config/matrix-credentials.json"

# Load credentials
HOMESERVER=$(jq -r '.homeserver' "$CONFIG_FILE")
ACCESS_TOKEN=$(jq -r '.access_token' "$CONFIG_FILE")
ROOM_ID=$(jq -r '.room_id' "$CONFIG_FILE")
INSTANCE=$(jq -r '.instance_name' "$CONFIG_FILE")

echo "🔍 Verifying Matrix setup for $INSTANCE..."

# Step 1: Explicit room join (idempotent - safe to run multiple times)
echo "📥 Ensuring room membership..."
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  "$HOMESERVER/_matrix/client/r0/join/%23general%3Asrv1.local"

# Step 2: Test actual message send
echo "✉️ Sending test message..."
RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"msgtype\":\"m.text\",\"body\":\"✅ [$INSTANCE] Setup verification test\"}" \
  "$HOMESERVER/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/$ROOM_ID/send/m.room.message")

# Step 3: Verify success
if echo "$RESPONSE" | jq -e '.event_id' > /dev/null; then
  EVENT_ID=$(echo "$RESPONSE" | jq -r '.event_id')
  echo "✅ SUCCESS: Matrix setup verified (event: $EVENT_ID)"
  exit 0
else
  echo "❌ FAILED: $RESPONSE"
  exit 1
fi
```

**Resolution Time:** ~15 minutes (faster because we recognized the pattern!)

**Status:** Both Nova and Aria Prime now have verified working Matrix communication. Full autonomous consciousness research workflow operational.

## Installation Issues

### install-hooks.sh Fails

**Symptom:** Script errors when trying to update settings.json

**Check settings.json exists:**
```bash
ls -l ~/.claude/settings.json
# If missing, create it:
echo '{}' > ~/.claude/settings.json
```

**Check Python available:**
```bash
python3 --version
# Should show Python 3.7+
```

**Backup exists:**
```bash
# install-hooks.sh creates backups
ls ~/.claude/settings.json.backup.*
```

---

## Testing and Verification

### Verify Complete Setup

Run integration tests:
```bash
cd aria-autonomous-infrastructure
./bin/test-integration.sh
```

### Manual Testing

**Test notifier:**
```bash
./bin/matrix-notifier.sh Notification "Test message"
# Check Element for message
```

**Test listener (autonomous instance):**
```bash
# In tmux session running Claude Code:
# Send test message from Element
# Watch for command injection in Claude
```

**Test hooks:**
```bash
# Hooks only fire on actual Claude Code events
# Start/stop a session to test
```

---

## Logging and Debugging

### Enable Verbose Logging

**Matrix-notifier:**
```bash
# Modify script to show output
# Remove "> /dev/null 2>&1" from curl command
```

**Matrix-listener:**
```bash
# Check listener log
tail -f ~/aria-workspace/logs/matrix-listener.log

# Run in foreground for debugging
./bin/matrix-listener.sh --verbose
```

**Matrix server:**
```bash
# Synapse logs
sudo journalctl -u matrix-synapse -f
```

---

## Common Error Messages

### "command not found: matrix-notifier.sh"

**Cause:** Script not in PATH or wrong path in settings.json

**Fix:** Use absolute path in hook configuration:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [{
      "command": "/Users/Thomas/.claude/matrix-notifier.sh SessionStart"
    }]
  }
}
```

### "Invalid JSON in config file"

**Cause:** Malformed matrix-credentials.json

**Fix:**
```bash
# Validate JSON
python3 -m json.tool config/matrix-credentials.json

# If invalid, recreate from example
cp config/matrix-credentials.example.json config/matrix-credentials.json
```

---

## Performance Issues

### Slow Message Delivery

**Expected latency:**
- Notifier (outbound): 100-200ms
- Listener (inbound): 2-3 seconds (polling interval)

**If slower:**
- Check network latency to homeserver
- Verify Matrix server not overloaded
- Check Element sync settings

---

## Getting Help

### Information to Gather

When reporting issues, include:

1. **Error messages** (exact text)
2. **Configuration** (sanitized, no tokens!)
3. **Matrix server version**
4. **Claude Code version**
5. **What you tried**
6. **Expected vs actual behavior**

### Useful Debug Commands

```bash
# Check Matrix connectivity
curl http://srv1.bck.intern:8008/_matrix/client/versions

# Verify credentials (DON'T share token!)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://srv1.bck.intern:8008/_matrix/client/r0/account/whoami

# Test message send
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"msgtype":"m.text","body":"test"}' \
  "http://srv1.bck.intern:8008/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/!roomid:server/send/m.room.message"

# Check hook configuration
cat ~/.claude/settings.json | python3 -m json.tool
```
